									<h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
									<p>I'm a neuroscientist interested in understanding how animals navigate in complex and dynamic environments. 
										In my free time I sew quilts and garments and practice Ashtanga yoga. Learn more about me on <a href="https://www.hannahhaberkern.com/" target="_blank" >my personal website</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Originally from Germany, I studied biomedicine at the University of Würzburg, before transitioning to a masters in 
										Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the ETH/University Zurich. For my PhD I worked with Berthold Hedwig at 
										the University of Cambridge and Vivek Jayaraman at HHMI Janelia working on navigational behaviors in crickets and 
										fruit flies. During this time I developed virtual reality techniques for head-fixed insects, which I combined with 
										in-vivo calcium imaging during my postdoc to study neural mechanisms supporting orientation in complex and dynamic 
										environments. In 2023 returned to Würzburg to start this lab.

								<h3>Postdoc</h3>
								<p>
									I am interested in circadian rhythms and complex behaviors in social insects. During my postdoc, I will explore 
									links between navigation and circadian rhythms as well as sleep on a neural level.
								</p>
								<p>
									Since my master’s degree in Turkey, I have worked on learning and memory, focusing on connections to circadian 
									rhythms. For my PhD as Marie-Curie fellow scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Israel, I worked with 
									Guy Bloch on the bumble bee clock. In addition to my academic training, I also define myself as an entrepreneur 
									since I ran my own biotech company in the past. I enjoy traveling, dancing (Argentina tango), reading, and 
									writing stories. In addition, I am also a big fan of gaming in my free time.

								<h3>PhD Student (shared with Ache Lab, Würzburg)</h3>
								<p>I am an aspiring neuroscientist with an interest in studying flexible decision-making behavior and how this helps 
									animals to adapt to their environment. I have experience working with <i>Drosophila</i>, conducting behavior assays to 
									study the impact of environmental stimuli on sleep and navigation. Besides my research, I enjoy exploring new 
									avenues for personal growth. I love reading, nurturing my green thumb, and exploring new places.
								</p>
								<p>I hold a Master's degree in Applied Biosciences and Biotechnology from Imperial College London, and have worked 
									in science communication and outreach. Originally from India, I moved to London for my master's and am now pursuing 
									a joint PhD in the Haberkern and Ache Labs at the University of Würzburg.

								<h3>PhD Student</h3>
								<p>
									I started my training in Psychology from Ozyegin University, Turkey, where I explored the relationship between 
									the transitivity of actions and perceptual capacity in humans under the tutelage of Ercenur Ünal. Driven by a 
									desire to study neural mechanisms underlying behavior, I moved to Bielefeld, Germany for my master’s in 
									Behavioral Neuroscience, where I worked with Martin Strube-Bloss on the Indian stick insect, and later in the 
									lab of Martin Egelhaaf on the structure change of the bumblebee learning flight. I also spent time in the 
									Couzin-Fuchs lab (Konstanz), investigating the behavioral phase change dynamics in the desert locust. In addition 
									to my laboratory research, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant on a DFG project.
								</p>
								<p>
									For my PhD, I aim to use connectomics and virtual reality to study of neural correlates of spatial navigation. 
									My goal is to uncover how neural circuit architecture and function enable animals to adapt to dynamic 
									environments which is crucial for effective behavior. Outside the lab, I'm a music fanatic and an alternative 
									music superfan –especially shoegaze and grunge– so I attend many concerts in my free time. I’m also an amateur 
									ambient techno music producer, with one album released and another on the way.

								<h3>PhD Student</h3>
								<p>
									I am interested in magnetoreception and navigation behavior in ants. During my master’s degree in Biosciences 
									at the University of Würzburg I explored the role of antennae as potential sensors for magnetic fields in 
									desert ants, Cataglyphis nodus. This research built on my earlier work during my bachelor’s degree, where I 
									sought to characterize the magnetic compass function in foraging desert ants. This field of study continues 
									to inspire my work today.
								</p>
								<p>
									Throughout my studies, I have gained extensive field experience. During the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2024, 
									I conducted fieldwork in Greece on C. nodus and took on a leadership role within the research team in 2024. 
									Additionally, from October 2023 to March 2024, I held a short-term fellowship with CRC/SFB 1372, 
									“Magnetoreception and Navigation in Vertebrates”.

								<h3>Master Student</h3>
								<p>I am interested in understanding the evolution as well as the neural underpinnings of complex animal behaviors. 
									Behaviors that I have worked on include navigation, collective and social behavior – all of it in insects!
								</p>
								<p>I did my Bachelors in Jena, investigating navigational strategies of the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis at the 
									Max Planck Institute of Chemical Biology. To pursue my passion for insects, I decided to enroll in the FOKUS 
									Master of Life Sciences at the JMU Würzburg in October 2024.

								<h3>Research Assistant</h3>
								<p>I am interested in neuroanatomy and its connection to development of behavior and orientation. My focus in 
									pervious experiments was on neuronal analysis in bumblebees and zebra fish, Danio rerio.
								</p>
								<p>During my Bachelor thesis in Würzburg I analyzed differences in the morphology in the dopaminergic 
									neurotransmitter system in zebrafish foxP2 mutants. Due to my passion to neuroanatomy, I decided to do one of 
									my masters main projects in the Haberkern lab to help with reconstructing a connectome of the clonal raider 
									ants brain.
